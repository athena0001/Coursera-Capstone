    "## Problem \n",
    "The main purpose of this project is to make it easier for people who are shifting to Scarborough from overseas to choose the appropriate neighbourhood to stay in. This project will cover facilities such as hospitals, cafes, schools, and more. Immigrations to Canada are increasing, and there are many people who are struggling with choosing where to stay, especially those who are not very economically privileged. This project aims to help those who are struggling with their decision making by giving them a basic insight on the facilities available in the area, so that they can assess which neighbourhood would be the most suitable for them."
